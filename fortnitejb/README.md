## A work-in-progress attempt to bypass Fortnite's jb detection. Currently blocks the file checks for Cydia, /bin/bash, /bin/sh & tries to enter a Safe Mode. Basically: does not work yet

### Note: I'd have reversed this further, but don't have enough storage to reverse a 88MB file in IDA, the current findings are done by debugging
